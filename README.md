### Kaggle-Liberty: Machine Learning Solution for Liberty Mutual Group: Property Inspection Prediction Challenge

This repository contains a machine learning solution developed for the **Liberty Mutual Group: Property Inspection Prediction** competition hosted on Kaggle. The competition's goal is to predict the probability that a given property will be flagged for inspection based on various risk factors. The solution leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and model optimization strategies to build an accurate predictive model.

#### Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Implements comprehensive data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and generating new features to enhance model performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides detailed EDA to understand data distributions, correlations, and feature importance, using visualizations and statistical summaries to identify key patterns and insights.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Explores multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and XGBoost. Each model is trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing algorithm for the given task.

- **Model Tuning and Optimization**: Utilizes hyperparameter tuning techniques, including Grid Search and Random Search, to optimize model parameters and achieve the best possible performance on the test data.

- **Model Evaluation and Validation**: Applies cross-validation methods, such as k-fold cross-validation, to validate model performance and prevent overfitting. Evaluation metrics like AUC-ROC, accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to assess model effectiveness.

- **Ensemble Techniques**: Demonstrates the use of ensemble learning methods, such as stacking and blending, to combine multiple models and improve overall prediction accuracy.

- **Reproducible Code**: The repository includes well-documented Jupyter Notebooks that provide a step-by-step guide through the entire modeling process, ensuring that the solution is easy to understand, reproduce, and extend.

#### Who Should Use This Repository:

- **Data Scientists and Machine Learning Practitioners**: Those interested in understanding and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
- **Kaggle Enthusiasts**: Participants looking for inspiration or reference to build solutions for similar Kaggle competitions.
- **Students and Researchers**: Individuals seeking practical examples of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation techniques.
